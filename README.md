## LLPrimeFinder
This program looks for primes numbers and stores them in a linked list

### Features:
- Use command line argument to set upper limit to check (defaults to 1000)
- 2 improvements over basic prime finding algorithm
    - Only checks odd numbers
    - Only checks the divisibility using the minimum amount of primes
- Shows the prime factors of numbers checked

### Future Features
- Making the algorithm more efficient
- Adding a UI

## LLBigNums
Want to deal with numbers larger than what *unsinged long long int* can deliver?
This program uses a linked list to store much much bigger numbers (tested up to 100 000!) 

### Features:
- Can multiply BigNum by integers
- Can add integeres and BigNum to BigNum
- Set up to calculate factorials using command line arguments (defaults to 100)
- Prints BigNum in slices of 1000

### Future Feature
- Substraction by int and BigNum
- Multiplication by BigNum
- Division by int and BigNum
- Implementation of other statistics functions
- UI implementation
